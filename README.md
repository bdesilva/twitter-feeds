# twitter-feeds
A UI that collect and displays twitter feeds while performing simple aggregation on them.

###### Pre-requisites:
1. Install gulp to run tests
  * `$ npm install --global gulp`

###### NOTE: Since this is a test, I included the node_modules folder for ease of use, however I would usually not include this and add it as part of .gitignore.
